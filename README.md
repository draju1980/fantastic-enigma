## Solution Overview: Terraform Deployment for Optimism OP Stack Node in AWS
In this solution, I used Terraform to deploy an Optimism OP Stack demo node on AWS, adhering to best practices in infrastructure setup and security configuration. Key steps and considerations included:

### 1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform:

*   Utilized Terraform to define and provision all AWS resources, ensuring consistent, repeatable deployments.
*   This IaC approach allows for easy scaling, modification, and version control of the entire infrastructure setup.

### 2. Security Best Practices:

*   SSH Access: Exported an SSH public key to the deployed instance, allowing secure, encrypted access while minimizing unauthorized access risks.
*   Restricted Ports: Opened only the specific ports required by Optimism OP Stack components, reducing the attack surface and ensuring that only essential services are accessible.

### 3. AWS Components:

*   VPC: Deployed within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to isolate and secure network resources.
*   Security Group: Configured to control inbound and outbound traffic, with rules specifically tailored to OP Stack’s needs.
*   Subnet and Internet Gateway: Configured for routing and internet access, with a route table linked to the subnet.
*   EC2 Instance: Launched an instance with the necessary resources and permissions to host the OP Stack demo, applying custom configuration through Terraform.

This deployment strategy combines Terraform’s automation and AWS’s robust infrastructure, creating a scalable, secure, and efficient environment for running Optimism’s OP Stack components on AWS.

For node management, Ansible is used to automate the deployment of all OP Stack components as Docker containers. To enhance security, HAProxy is configured as a reverse proxy, and an iptables firewall is employed to restrict access to only the necessary ports on the node. Key OP Stack components, such as op-geth and op-node's P2P port, are exposed to the internet, while other RPC and WSS services are routed through HAProxy. 

Please find the diagram below outlining the components within the nodes.

### How to Deploy an OP Stack Node with All Components

Follow these step-by-step instructions to deploy and configure OP Stack nodes using Terraform and Ansible.

#### 1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/draju1980/fantastic-enigma.git
```
#### 2. Install Terraform
Make sure Terraform is installed on your local machine. You can verify the installation with:
```sh
terraform -version
```

#### 3. Initialize Terraform
Navigate to the cloned repository directory and initialize Terraform:
```sh
terraform init
```

#### 4. Preview Changes (Dry Run)
To review the planned changes before deploying, run:

```sh
terraform plan
```

#### 5. Deploy the Infrastructure
If everything looks good, deploy the instance:

```sh
terraform apply
```

Terraform will prompt for confirmation. Type yes and press Enter to confirm. Once deployed, Terraform will display the public IP and SSH command for accessing the instance. 
Example output:
```sh
Apply complete! Resources: 8 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

public_ip = "13.57.24.182"
ssh_command = "ssh ubuntu@13.57.24.182"
```
Your SSH public key will be automatically copied to the new instance, so you can log in using the ubuntu user.

#### 6. Update the Inventory File
Edit the opstack/inventory/inventory.yml file with the new public IP, network details, peerid, and node_p2p_priv. To generate peerid and node_p2p_priv values, run the script:

```sh
./opstack/files/generate_keys.sh
```
Note: Only one node should be designated as the sequencer in the network. For all other nodes, set the sequencer value to false in the inventory file.

#### 7. Trigger Deployment with GitHub Actions
After updating inventory.yml, push your changes to the master branch. This will automatically start the GitHub Actions workflow, which uses Ansible to deploy OP Stack components to the remote target node.
Note: If you are running the Terraform script from your local machine, make sure to update the ANSIBLE_VAULT secret in the repository with the contents of your local ~/.ssh/id_rsa file. This ensures that the GitHub Actions workflow can run the Ansible playbook without errors.

#### 8. Monitor Deployment Progress
You can view the Ansible tasks running in the GitHub Actions tab here: https://github.com/draju1980/fantastic-enigma/actions


### Post-Deployment: Verifying OP Stack Node Components
Once the GitHub Actions workflow completes, the Ansible job will have installed the following components: op-geth, op-node, op-batcher, op-proposer, HAProxy, firewall, Grafana agent, and other dependencies.

To ensure the node is operating correctly, follow these steps to verify key services. Replace the example public IP 13.57.24.182 with your own, as provided in the Terraform output.

#### 1. Check OP-Geth and OP-Node RPC Endpoints
Verify that OP-Geth and OP-Node are active by querying their RPC endpoints.

##### OP-Geth Endpoint Verification

Use the following commands to check eth_blockNumber and eth_syncing statuses on OP-Geth:

```sh
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}' http://13.57.24.182:8545 | jq
```

Expected Similar Output:

```sh
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": "0x176e"
}
```
```sh
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_syncing","params":[],"id":67}' http://13.57.24.182:8545 | jq
```
Expected Output (if synced):
```sh
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 67,
  "result": false
}
```

##### OP-Node Endpoint Verification
To check the optimism_syncStatus RPC method on OP-Node, run:

```sh
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"optimism_syncStatus","params":[],"id":1}' http://13.57.24.182:8547 | jq
```
Expected output will include various sync statuses, including current_l1, finalized_l1, safe_l1, finalized_l2, etc., indicating the L1 and L2 sync states of the node.

#### 2. Check Grafana Agent Status
To verify the Grafana agent is collecting metrics, open the metrics endpoint in a browser at:

```sh
http://13.57.24.182:12345/graph
```

This should display Grafana’s scraping interface. Make sure the public IP matches the IP output from your Terraform deployment.

### Important Note: 
For this challenge, I am using the following addresses for the OP-node, OP-sequencer, OP-batcher, and OP-proposer. However, when setting up your own node, please generate new addresses for all OP Stack components.
