## Solution Overview: Terraform Deployment for Optimism OP Stack Node in AWS
In this solution, I used Terraform to deploy an Optimism OP Stack demo node on AWS, adhering to best practices in infrastructure setup and security configuration. Key steps and considerations included:

### 1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform:

*   Utilized Terraform to define and provision all AWS resources, ensuring consistent, repeatable deployments.
*   This IaC approach allows for easy scaling, modification, and version control of the entire infrastructure setup.

### 2. Security Best Practices:

*   SSH Access: Exported an SSH public key to the deployed instance, allowing secure, encrypted access while minimizing unauthorized access risks.
*   Restricted Ports: Opened only the specific ports required by Optimism OP Stack components, reducing the attack surface and ensuring that only essential services are accessible.

### 3. AWS Components:

*   VPC: Deployed within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to isolate and secure network resources.
*   Security Group: Configured to control inbound and outbound traffic, with rules specifically tailored to OP Stack’s needs.
*   Subnet and Internet Gateway: Configured for routing and internet access, with a route table linked to the subnet.
*   EC2 Instance: Launched an instance with the necessary resources and permissions to host the OP Stack demo, applying custom configuration through Terraform.

This deployment strategy combines Terraform’s automation and AWS’s robust infrastructure, creating a scalable, secure, and efficient environment for running Optimism’s OP Stack components on AWS.

For node management, Ansible is used to automate the deployment of all OP Stack components as Docker containers. To enhance security, HAProxy is configured as a reverse proxy, and an iptables firewall is employed to restrict access to only the necessary ports on the node. Key OP Stack components, such as op-geth and op-node's P2P port, are exposed to the internet, while other RPC and WSS services are routed through HAProxy.
